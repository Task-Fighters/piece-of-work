A newly started flight booker company needs your help, and they need it quickly! Theyâ€™re supposed to publish their application and business within two weeks but haven't even gotten started on the booking-page itself. They have the frontend part under control, thatâ€™s for an external consultant to fix for them, but they need you to fix the backend! The requirements wonâ€™t tell you everything, some of the parts of the backend youâ€™ll have to figure out yourself!
Â 
Purpose

After this week youâ€™ll have gained a lot of experience in backend database handling as well as setting up proper API routes as well as a fully functioning API prototype which can be shown on your portfolio. Youâ€™ll also have gained familiarity with creating an API for a frontend someone else is making.Â 

Remember to hand it in by 18:00 on Friday and send it to pgp-submit@appliedtechnology.se

And as always, weâ€™ll send out a form on Friday to hear with everyone how it went. If anyone had a really hard time with this test we will see what we can do to help ðŸ™‚
